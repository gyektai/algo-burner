Burner account for Algorand's blockchain

Apparently it was a problem that people couldn't verifiably burn ASAs, and the current best way I've seen was sending the ASA to an account that you create and opt in and then rekey that account to a verifiably unknown account. I thought that was clunky so I made another way.

Have the contract opt in to an asset, and then you can send as many of that asset to the account and completely lose access to them! Gone for good, so be careful!

The account address is JBPZI53GLJ4FW3KHKHC6PDWHRQARLRGC7DM33IT7XODFMIFNJW3CTUAIEM and I initially funded it at txn FIWRGYKBNL6RWWVI3Z5MPTNOKZQU25CQIVPRUIAVYHLH57XXD3TQ
